ELITEWOLF:

This repository will contain various ICS/SCADA/OT focused signatures and analytics. The end goal is to enable Critical Infrastructure Defenders, Intrusion Analysts, and others to implement continuous and vigilant system monitoring.
WARNING: These signatures/analytics aren't necessarily malicious activity. They will require follow on analysis to truly determine if this activity is malicious or not. 


Background
Cyber actors have demonstrated their continued willingness to conduct malicious cyber activity
against Critical Infrastructure (CI) by exploiting Internet-accessible and vulnerable Operational Technology (OT) assets. Due to the
increase in adversary capabilities and activity, the criticality to U.S. national security and way of life, and the vulnerability
of OT systems, civilian infrastructure makes attractive targets for foreign powers attempting to do harm to US interests or
retaliate for perceived US aggression. It is highly recommended that ICS/SCADA/OT Critical Infrastructure owners and operators implement a continuous and vigilant system monitoring program. 
Please reference the following Cybersecurity Advisory for further background: PP-20-0622, https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jul/23/2002462846/-1/-1/OT_ADVISORY-DUAL-OFFICIAL-20200722.PDF


SNORT Rules
WARNING: These signatures/analytics aren't necessarily malicious activity. They will require follow on analysis to truly determine if this activity is malicious or not. The provided SNORT rules are alerting rules. Investigation for accuracy is required for hits. The rules have been tested, but every system can be configured differently, so ensure that the signature is triggered properly or is adjusted as needed based on the sensors and the environment.
